## About

WorkoutPartner aims to alleviate the stress of going to the gym and not knowing what to do, a major hurdle for many looking to get or stay in shape. It allows users to create workouts prior to going to the gym, and even seek help from trainers in the creation of their workouts. Progress reports encourage motivation and make tracking accomplished workouts easy.

## Why build WorkoutPartner?

The idea came about, as many do, over a few beers with a friend. While discussing my new career path with a friend who, in addition to law school, is a personal trainer. He voiced concern about how his field is often stuck in an age of having hand-written workout routines that get lost and quickly outdated. After talking with him and learning more about what would be beneficial to help support his clients, the idea of WorkoutPartner was born. The fact that the need for such an app is so obvious both for myself and for others is something that keeps me excited about it.
